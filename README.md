## What is Vision Board Bliss?

Vision Board Bliss is a digital vision board application that helps you visualize and manifest your goals. Just like creating a physical vision board with magazine cutouts and poster board, but with the convenience and flexibility of digital tools.

Think of it as your personal dream canvas where you can:
- Add images that represent your goals
- Organize your aspirations visually
- Keep your dreams front and center in your daily life
